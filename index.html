					<p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup
						instructions, they've moved to <u>their own section</u>. Continue reading for an introduction to the
						documentation,
						Native Components, React, and more!</p>

						<p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and
							the
							app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs
							APIs
							as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <em>bundles
								of
								reusable, nestable code</em>. You can learn more about React in the next section. But first,
							let‚Äôs
							cover
							how components work in React Native.</p>

					<p>React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with
						JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can
						get you started or can serve as a refresher course.</p>
					<p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
					<p><strong>+ components.</strong> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples:
						friendly, approachable
						creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
					<p><strong>+ JSX.</strong> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside
						JavaScript like
						so: <mark>&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</mark>.</p>
					<p>The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX
						is
						JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <mark>name</mark> for the cat,
						name, and
						embedding it with curly braces inside <mark>&lt;Text&gt;</mark></p>
					<p><strong>+ props.</strong> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</p>
					<p><strong>+ state.</strong> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how
						components render, state
						is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time
						or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>

					<h2 class="header-h2" id="handling">Handling text input</h2>
					<p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <em>onChangeText</em> prop
						that
						takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a
						function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>
					<p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
						language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello
						there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
